name: Predator Prey
description: This is a Predator-Prey simulation implemented in C using OpenMP, developed as part of an assignment for a Parallel Computing class. The core idea behind this implementation is to maintain a list of "wanted" grid cellsâ€”representing the target positions that creatures intend to move to. By leveraging parallelism, we efficiently process these movements, as conflicts only occur when multiple creatures attempt to move to the same grid cell. This approach optimizes performance while effectively handling movement conflicts in a concurrent environment.
